# Health Tips Recommendation System

The Healthcare recommendation system is designed to provide personalized health tips to users based on their unique profiles, which include attributes such as age, gender, and medical conditions.
It leverages a **content-based filtering** approach, using **Cosine Similarity** to compare users’ profiles (age, gender, and medical condition) with similar profiles in the dataset. Based on this similarity, the system recommends relevant health tips to users.

## Dataset

The Dataset include the following key features:

1. **Age :** Continuous numeric variable that is scaled.
2. **Gender :** Categorical variable that is label-encoded.
3. **Medical Condition :** Categorical variable that lists the user's health issues (*e.g., diabetes, hypertension*) and is label-encoded.
These attributes are preprocessed to convert them into numerical format, enabling effective similarity calculation.
4. **Health Tips:** A list of health tips associated with each user based on their medical condition.


 
## Scope of the Solution

#### In-Scope: 

User Profile Matching: The system currently uses a similarity matrix to recommend health tips based on profiles of similar users in the training dataset. This is limited to predefined features and simple recommendation mechanisms.

Health Tip Recommendations: The system can recommend at least 3 unique health tips to users in the test set based on the similarity of their profiles to training users. This offers personalized advice based on medical condition, gender, age, or any other features contributing to the similarity measure.


#### Future Scope : 
Enhance Feature Engineering :
Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and categorize health tips based on user sentiment and feedback.

User Feedback Integration :
Implementing a feedback loop to gather user satisfaction ratings on recommendations could lead to more tailored suggestions over time. Users can indicate which tips were helpful or not, enhancing the system’s learning.




## Conclusion:
The health tips recommendation system leverages cosine similarity to provide personalized health advice based on user profiles. Through careful preprocessing, thoughtful model selection, and ongoing evaluations, this system shows promise in enhancing user health management. By implementing suggested improvements, the model's efficacy can be further increased, ultimately leading to better health outcomes for users.
